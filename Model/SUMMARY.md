# Multi-City Recommendation System - Final Summary

## What We Built

A complete AI-powered restaurant and hotel recommendation system that:

### Key Features
- **Multi-city support** with city-specific budget thresholds
- **Smart query understanding** from natural language
- **Preference detection** (budget, luxury, cuisine, quality)
- **Deduplication** to avoid showing duplicate restaurant names
- **ML-powered scoring** using Random Forest algorithms
- **Real-time recommendations** with detailed information

### Supported Cities
- Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Pune, Hyderabad
- Each with custom budget thresholds and specialty cuisines

### Data Sources
- 51,000+ restaurants from Zomato
- 400+ hotels from OYO
- Ratings, prices, locations, cuisines, reviews

## Key Terminologies Explained

### Machine Learning Terms
- **Random Forest**: Algorithm using multiple decision trees for accurate predictions
- **Classification**: Categorizing items as budget-friendly or premium
- **Feature Engineering**: Converting raw data into useful ML features
- **Scoring Algorithm**: Mathematical ranking of recommendations
- **Deduplication**: Removing duplicate entries for variety

### System Terms
- **City Detection**: Automatically identifying city from user query
- **Preference Extraction**: Understanding budget/luxury/cuisine preferences
- **Budget Thresholds**: Price limits defining "budget-friendly" per city
- **Diversity Algorithm**: Ensuring varied recommendations

## How to Run

### Quick Commands
```bash
# Interactive mode (recommended)
python budget_recommendation_system.py

# Single query
python demo.py "budget restaurants in Mumbai"

# Quick demo
python quick_start.py

# Test all features
python test_system.py
```

### Example Queries
- "budget friendly restaurants"
- "luxury hotels in Mumbai"
- "best south indian food"
- "restaurants in Banashankari"
- "premium dining"

## System Architecture

### Input Processing
1. **Query Analysis**: Detects city and preferences
2. **Data Filtering**: Filters by city, budget, cuisine
3. **ML Scoring**: Ranks based on ratings, popularity, specialties
4. **Deduplication**: Removes duplicate names for variety

### Output Generation
- Shows restaurant/hotel name, location, city
- Displays ratings, prices, cuisines
- Indicates budget-friendly status
- Provides preference context

## Technical Implementation

### Classes and Methods
- `MultiCityRecommendationSystem`: Main recommendation engine
- `detect_city_from_query()`: Identifies target city
- `extract_preferences()`: Understands user preferences
- `_get_diverse_restaurants()`: Ensures variety in results
- `_calculate_restaurant_score()`: ML-based ranking

### Data Processing
- Cleans ratings from text format (e.g., "4.1/5" → 4.1)
- Extracts prices from strings (e.g., "₹500" → 500)
- Classifies budget vs premium based on city thresholds
- Removes duplicates while preserving diversity

## Sample Output

```
Found 3 Recommendations
City: Bangalore
Preference: Budget
