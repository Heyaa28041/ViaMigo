An intelligent recommendation system that suggests restaurants and hotels across multiple Indian cities based on user preferences and location using machine learning on real Zomato/OYO data.

Key Features:
- Multi-city support (Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Pune, Hyderabad)
- Smart preference detection from natural language queries
- City-specific budget thresholds and cuisine specialties
- ML-powered classification and scoring
